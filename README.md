# Superstore-Sales-Insights
Superstore is a Super Store Corporation. Sylvia is the VP of Sales and she is conducting a review of the company discount policy. . He wants a dashboard where he
can track how well Discount Mart is doing for this year (in terms of Sales, Profit and Quantity
Sold).

Sylvia like to investigate if there is a relationship between discounted sales and profit, and how much the company is profiting or losing based on discounted sales. 

She would also like to know how well categories are performing as well as different regions.

She also wants to see if there are opportunities for efficiencies with respect to how discounts are handled. Perhaps certain customers are receiving more discounts than other customers. Perhaps certain product categories or product segments are receiving more discounts than others. Sylvia has given you wide latitude to explore this question however you see fit, and will ultimately make a recommendation to the board of directors based on your findings.
